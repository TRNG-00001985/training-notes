## Generics

- Generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces and methods.

## Asymptotic Notation


- Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's time or space complexity.
- Big Omega is used to describe the lower bound.
- Theta is used to describe the average bound.

## Time and Space complexity

- used to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm
- Time complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input.
- Space complexity  is the amount of memory an algorithm uses in terms of the size of the input.

## Java Collection Framework

### List Interface

#### ArrayList

- ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the List interface. It maintains the order of insertion and allows random access to elements.
-  Allows null elements.
-  Not thread-safe.
  
**Methods**

- add(E e)
- add(int index, E element)
- get(int index)
- remove(int index)
- remove(Object o)
- set(int index, E element)

#### LinkedList

- LinkedList is a doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces. It maintains the order of insertion and allows sequential access to elements.
- Allows null elements.
- Not thread-safe.


**Methods**

- All  methods from List
- All methods from Queue and Deque

#### Iterator

- Iterator is an interface providing methods to iterate over a collection. It allows traversal of elements in a forward direction.

**methods**

- hasNext()
- next()
- remove()

#### Vector

- Vector is a synchronized, resizable array implementation of the List interface. It maintains the order of insertion.
- Allows null elements.
- supports all ArrayList Methods


##### Stack

- Stack is a subclass of Vector that implements a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of elements.
- Allows null elements.
- Thread-safe


**methods**

- push(E item)
- pop()
- peek()
- empty()
- search(Object o)

### Queue Interface

#### ArrayDeque

- ArrayDeque is a resizable array implementation of the Deque interface. It supports insertion, removal, and access from both ends.
- Allows null values
- Not thread-safe.

**Methods**
- add(element)
- offer(element)
- element()
- poll()

#### PriorityQueue

- objects are processed based on priority.
- based on priority heap
- doesnt allow null values
- Not thread-safe.


### Set Interface

#### HashSet

- HashSet is a collection that uses a hash table for storage. It implements the Set interface and provides methods to add, remove, and query the presence of elements.
- doesnt permit null elements
- Not thread-safe

**methods**

- add(E e)
- remove(Object o)
- contains(Object o)
- clear()

#### TreeSet

- TreeSet is a NavigableSet implementation based on a TreeMap
- The elements in a TreeSet are ordered using their natural ordering or a Comparator provided at set creation time
- Doesnt permit null elements
- Not thread-safe

**methods**
- all HashSet methods
- first()
- last()
- higher(E e)
- lower(E e)
- ceiling(E e)
- floor(E e)
- pollFirst()
- pollLast()

## Map Interface

### HashMap

- HashMap is a hash table-based implementation of the Map interface. It permits null values and the null key
- Allows null keys and null values
- Not thread-safe

**methods**

- put(K key, V value)
- remove(Object key)
- get(Object key)
- clear()
- size()
- isEmpty()
- containsKey(Object key)
- containsValue(Object value)
- keySet()
- values()
- entrySet()

### TreeMap

- TreeMap is a Red-Black tree-based implementation of the Map interface
- The map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys or by a Comparator provided at map creation time
- doesnt allow null keys. Null values are permitted
- Not thread-safe

**methods**

- All HashMap methods
- firstKey()
- lastKey()
- higherKey(K key)
- lowerKey(K key)
- ceilingKey(K key)
- floorKey(K key)
- pollFirstEntry()
- pollLastEntry()

### HashTable

- Hashtable is a legacy class
- doesnt allow null keys or null values.
- Thread-safe. 

**methods**

- All HashMap methods

### Equals, Hashcode

- The equals() method is used to compare two objects for equality. The equals() method from the Object class compares the memory addresses of the objects.

- The hashCode() method returns an integer value, generated by a hashing algorithm. The hashCode() method is used in hash-based collections like HashMap, HashSet, and Hashtable.
- 
## Collections Class

- contains static utility methods to manipulate collections like sorting, searching and reversing.

**methods**

- sort
- binarySearch
- reverse
- shuffle
- copy
- min
- max

## Comparable Interface

- Comparable is an interface defining a strategy of comparing an object with other objects of the same type.
- A class can Implement the comparable interface and override the `compareTo` method

## Comparator Interface

- used to compare two objects
- A class can Implement the comparator interface and override the `compare` method
