    - Caching
    - Connection Pooling

### Caching

`READ_ONLY`: Objects donâ€™t change once inside the cache.

`NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE`: Objects change (eventually) after the corresponding database entry is updated; this guarantees eventual consistency.

`READ_WRITE`: Objects change (immediately) after the corresponding database entry is updated; this guarantees strong consistency by using "soft" locks.

`TRANSACTIONAL`: Objects change using distributed XA transactions, ensuring data integrity; this guarantees either total success or rolling back all changes.
