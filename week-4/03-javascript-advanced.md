#  JavaScript

- JavaScript is  the most commonly used **client side scripting langauge**. 
-  JS is *high-level*, *multi-paradign*, *interpreted* programming language.
   - used to create dynamic web pages(using DOM Manipulation).
- JS is dynamically and loosely typed.(Doesnt enforce type safety).
- Single thereaded(It runs using whats called an Event loop)
- Used in HTML
- Officialy called as ECMAScript


### DatTypes

- Primitives
  - number
  - boolean
  - bigint
  - string
  - symbol
  - undefined
  - null

- References (Objects)
  - Array
  - object

#### Type Coresion

- implicit conversion of values from one data type to another.

### Operators

1. arithmetic
2. comparision
3. logical


### Template Literal

- literals delimited in backtick.
- allow multi line strings and string interpolation with embedded expressions.

### Variale Scope

- visibility of values and expressions.
- if the values are not present in te current scope they are not available for use.

1. Global: the default scope. global visibility.
2. Module: scope for code in module mode
3. Function: specific to the function
4. Block: specific to a block of code `{}`

### let, const and var

var: function scoped

let: block scoped

const: block scoped. immutable


### Strict mode

- additional constrains to turn the mistakes into errors.
- intriduced in ECMAScript 5.

```js
"use strict";
```

### Arrays


-  storing a collection of items under a single variable name.
-  resizable, shallow copy oprations and zero indexed.
-  methods: push, pop, splice, sort, reverse, indexOf, length

### Control Flow

1. if-else
2. switch
3. for
4. while
5. do-while
